# Original Code: R hypoxia by Natalie Davidson
# Edited , modified and maintaining by Alva Rani James (Updated as of Feb 7.02.19)
# Added 2 features, 1. cancer type of user's interest
# 2. Added the Bayes score to Hypoxia score matrix. Line 224 - 2240 Alva: Added new lines to bind the bayes with the Hypoxia score, previously Natalie did Bayes Score, but it was not binded
# The script is useable from one sample to any number of sample of interest now, previously the requirement was minimum of 2
# Commented lines 301-313 Which is ROCR sensitivity and specificity


## The major changes there are in the R script,

 The script `Project_new_HIF.R` is changed a lot for the current requirement

## Added  new features and functionality for visualization

1. cancer type of user's interest This is added in Set_R_paths.R

 2. Added the Bayes score to Hypoxia score matrix. 

	3. Removed these lines 224 - 240:  Additionally, I added a new function [Lines 246-265, called as `classify_bayes_score`], outside `get_prob_hypoxic`, where this was defined previously. By doing so now in the results directory there are file names as New_patient_hypoxia_Bayes_score.tsv, with both Bayes and Hypoxia score, which was not the case with the previous legacy script.

3. The plotter function for comparative visualization of the backgrounds and visualize where the Hypoxia score falls within the background, for a user given sample.

The script is useable from one sample to any number of sample of interest now, previously the requirement was minimum of 2
Commented lines 301-313 Which is for calculating sensitivity and specificity library ROCR. 


As of Feburauray 15th, the parameters previously used for alignment using STAR
aligner is changed to NEXUS (defined) parameters in order to manintain
consistancy between workflows and therefore derive same outputs.
The following are major changes.
	--twopassMode Basic  (used by us, not by them)

	[I prefer twopassMode on, but for reproduction we need to remove it]

	--readFilesCommand zcat (used by them) / --readFilesCommand gunzip   -c  (used by us)
	 [we should also use zcat]

	--limitSjdbInsertNsj 2000000 (used by us, not by them) [is reasonable, but remove for reproduction]

	--outSAMstrandField intronModif (used by them) / --outSAMstrandField intronMotif (used by us)
	[they have a typo, but we should use theirs for reproducing, then change to the correct]

	--outSAMattrRGline ID::EOC11CTRL (used by us, not by them)
	[ok to use, but should be filled with meaningful information related to the sample, not with the default taken from a different pipeline]

	--outSAMunmapped Within (used by them) / --outSAMunmapped None (used by us)
	[depends on whether one wants to archive the fastq files or not, should not have an effect on the results]

	--outSAMmultNmax 1 (used by us, not by them)
	[makes the output smaller. We usually only keep the best anyways, but I would suggest to remove so all multimappers are output]
